Q20:
It can be hacker attack, stuck on a dead loop because coding error, or business running so well.

We have to collect more data about this: server log, error log, server record, user behavior, 
and user IP .... Coding problem is easy to define, it  will show on the server log, and error log. 
We need to check out more service details and user behavior if we are concerned about hacking.
